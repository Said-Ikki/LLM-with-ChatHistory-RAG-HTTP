Note: whats missing is you need to create a test.db database with the correct columns
- the code to set that up is commnted out in ping.py
- you may need to insert some dummy records in there 
as well, make a docs folder in the same place once you download the project
- put in some document to make it work, pdf word excel and pptx all work
